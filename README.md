# practice-cookie-stand
Practice running the cookie stand code assignments for 201

Create two new pages within your project. One for Sales Data (sales.html) and another for the homepage (index.html).

Sales Data
Within your javascript file (example: app.js), create separate JS object literals for each shop location that outputs the following to the sales.html file:

1)  Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties - DONE
2)  Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random - DONE
3)  Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated - DONE
4)  Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location - DONE
5)  Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
6)  Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

Home Page
Read below for the requirements of your index.html page.

Note: Everything listed below is a stretch goal for lab 06. All of these requirements will be required for the final submission of the project, so start implementing these early.

Done - In addition to the provided picture of the fish, your index.html file should contain:

A custom Google font for highlights
A specified standard sans-serif web font for data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica)
A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times, etc.)
Specified different font colors for all three font usages
Done - A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background)
A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!)
Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user.
